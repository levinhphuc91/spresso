# React + TypeScript + Vite: Table Component Exercise

This project involves creating a reusable table component using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It showcases the power of modern web development tools and practices, providing an efficient and type-safe development experience.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running:

`npm run install`

Note: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to use npm commands.

## Running the Application

To start the development server and run the application in your browser:

`npm run dev`

This command will compile your TypeScript code, start the Vite development server, and open the application in your default web browser. You'll be able to see your table component in action and make real-time changes to your code.

## Test

The project is configured with testing utilities to help ensure the reliability and integrity of your component. To run the test suite:

`npm run test`

This command executes all test files within the project, outputting the results to your terminal. It's a great way to verify that your table component functions as expected across different scenarios and after any changes.

## Features

The table component you'll create is designed to be reusable and customizable. Key features include:

1. Dynamic data rendering: Display a variety of data dynamically passed as props.
2. Sorting: Users can sort data by clicking on column headers.
3. Pagination: Navigate through pages of data to improve readability.
4. Search/filtering: Quickly find specific rows based on user input.
5. Selection: Select and highlight rows to perform actions on them.
